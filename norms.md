Establishing Norms


Each group should discuss and provide an answer for the following questions

1. What does this group do when two or more members disagree (ex. on a technical approach, a technology choice, etc)?
Do you vote? Does the whole group get involved? Do you get someone else to decide?

* Vote / group discussion


What does this group do when a member is frustrated?
What strategy do you use to talk about it? What do you do if you're the frustrated person? What do you do if you're the person someone is frustrated with? Imagine a situation where Person A thinks that Person B is not pulling their weight - write a script for how you think that conversation should go.

* Talk it out, tell funny jokes and vibe with pizza.
* script:
- Hey this project is bumming me out, I can't figure out this bug on the nav bar
- Don't worry, lets talk it out. let me order all of us some pizza on me and we're good to go


What does this group do when we merge our work together?
Do we do it together? Do we require sign off from someone else?

* For the first few merges, we can have a huddle session where we can screen share the merge. It would be helpful to hear and see how each individual worked on the branch and see how it merges with the master.

When does this group ask for help?
After 10 minutes? 15? 20? After everybody's tried to solve the problem? What strategies do we use before we ask for help?

* After everybody's tried to tackle on the problem. As a team we are responsible for the final product.

How do we pair? What do we do when two group members pair with each other?
Do members of a pair decide their own norms? Do they do things like keep a timer to switch positions? How often do we switch partners?

* Descretion will be left up to the pairs. Key point would be to communicate with the whole group on outcomes / goals of the member pairs.

How does this group approach work "after hours" (i.e. after normal class hours and weekends)?
Is it okay to work on your own after hours? How do we keep the group informed? Do we only work after hours when we can pair? When the entire group is present?

* Up to the individual, but communication will be key. We can will be meeting in the morning and after lunch, but will constantly be in the rooms. At 5pm, we will have a pedal-off zone where we will discuss and wind down and review.

What time does this group have daily stand up?

* 11:15am for get together (with Dan), 2:30pm after lunch, and 5pm for wind down / review / discussions. (subject to change, again communication is key!)

Making sure this works and is updated.
